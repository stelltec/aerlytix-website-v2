This privacy policy should be read in conjunction with our [Cookie Policy](https://www.aerlytix.com/cookies-policy/).

### The data we collect about you

### How we use your data

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your data in the following circumstances:

In each of the above cases, we minimize the data stored in each location based on what is required to effectively support our services to you.

### Change of purpose

We will only use your data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

### Disclosure of your data

We may share your data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.

- *Internal third parties*, being other companies in the Aerlytix group
- *External third parties* being service providers who offer IT and administration services
- *Professional advisers* including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services

### Data protection

We limit access to your data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### Data retention

How long will you use my data for?

We will only retain your data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your data, the purposes for which we process your data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. Further detail in respect of how long we retain data collected through our cookies can be found in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.aerlytix.com/cookies-policy/).

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

### Your legal rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under Data Protection Laws in relation to your data. You have the right to:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This right applies unless we can demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms or where we need to use your information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact [info@aerlytix.com](mailto:info@aerlytix.com).

### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
