      <h4>Business Challenge and Problem</h4>
      <p>There is significant exposure to airlines, MROs, traders and lessors, and there is a currently stagnant ABS market. To manage this exposure banks and lenders often rely on their debtor counterparties to monitor and report on metal condition.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Lenders have been faced with a need to restructure financing arrangements, discounted buyouts, and refinance underwater facilities. Too often lenders are left with the unencumbered asset, resulting in many lenders pulling back or exiting the space entirely.</p>
