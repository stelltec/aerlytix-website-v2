      <h4>Business Challenge and Problem</h4>
      <p>As lessors approach a three-digit owned or managed fleet size, significant business inefficienies are caused by the amount of data, third-party providers, and turbulent nature of aviation.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Everything from Portfolio Management to FP&A becomes cumbersome and manual with reliance on Excel and legacy systems. A “firefighting approach” to repossessions and re-deliveries is widespread, with major lessors often running maintenance and lease forecasts on less than 30 aircraft monthly.</p>
      <h4>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">Purpose built for aviation finance, Aerlytix connects client data within a centralized web-based infrastructure. Through the integration of both external data sources and internal asset management systems, customers benefit from the systems proven ability to forecast fleets of 600+ aircraft in seconds with the most up-to-date data available.</p>
      <h4>Business Impacts</h4>
      <p>Aerlytix drove a 75% reduction in the FTE hours required to run a monthly maintenance and lease forecasting process. Also the lessor benefits by having up-to-date data available for all assets, to support improved decision making.</p>
<p>As a centralized strategic infrastructure, outputs from the Aerlytix analytics suite benefit all functions through enhanced Portfolio Management, FP&A reporting, technical, compliance, and audit.</p>
